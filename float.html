    <!-- Explanation of CSS -->
        CSS, which stands for "Cascading Style Sheets," is a programming language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language, typically HTML (HyperText Markup Language) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). The main goal of CSS is to separate the structure of the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing better management and control of the visual style of a website.
        With CSS, you can define style rules such as color, font, text size, layout, margins, borders, etc. These rules are then applied to specified HTML elements, providing more precise and consistent control over the appearance of a website.
        Stylesheets can be embedded directly into the HTML document, included from external files, or generated dynamically by server-side programming languages. CSS styles can be applied hierarchically and cascaded, hence the term "Cascading" in the language name. This means that styles defined at different levels can be inherited and combined, allowing efficient and modular management of a web page's design.
